Hash functions are widely used, so it is desirable to increase their speed and
security. This package provides three hash functions that are resistant to
hash flooding and outperform existing algorithms: a faster version of SipHash,
a data-parallel variant of SipHash using tree hashing, and an even faster
algorithm we call HighwayHash.

SipHash is a fast but cryptographically strong pseudo-random function by
Aumasson and Bernstein [https://www.131002.net/siphash/siphash.pdf].

SipTreeHash slices inputs into 8-byte packets and computes their SipHash in
parallel, which is faster when processing at least 96 bytes.

HighwayHash is a new way of mixing inputs which may inspire new
cryptographically strong hashes. Large inputs are processed at a rate of
0.3 cycles per byte, and latency remains low even for small inputs.
HighwayHash is faster than SipHash for all input sizes, with about 5 times
higher throughput at 1 KiB.

## Applications

Expected applications include DOS-proof hash tables and random generators.

SipHash is immune to hash flooding because multi-collisions are infeasible to
compute. This makes it suitable for hash tables storing user-controlled data.

The output is also indistinguishable from a uniform random function, which
means it can be used for choosing random subsets (e.g. for A/B experiments).
Such generators are idempotent (repeatable/deterministic), which is useful
in parallel algorithms and for testing/verification.

We have verified the bit distribution and avalanche properties of HighwayHash.
A formal security analysis is pending publication, though new cryptanalysis
tools may still need to be developed for further analysis.

## SipHash

Our SipHash implementation is a fast and portable drop-in replacement for
the reference C code. Outputs are identical for the given test cases (messages
between 0 and 63 bytes).

Interestingly, it is about twice as fast as a SIMD implementation using SSE4.1
(https://goo.gl/80GBSD). This is presumably due to the lack of SIMD bit rotate
instructions.

## SipTreeHash

Even faster throughput can be achieved by logically partitioning inputs into
interleaved streams and hashing them independently. The resulting hashes are
then combined via original SipHash. Such "tree hash" constructions retain the
safety guarantees of the underlying hash function.

Example: 64 byte input = 8 qwords. Interpret them as four interleaved
streams: A0, A1, A2, A3, B0, B1, B2, B3. Compute four separate hashes of
A0, A1, A2, A3 via four-way SIMD; update each of these with the second qwords
B0, B1, B2, B3. Each independent hash result H_i includes A_i and B_i. Finally,
combine the H_i into a single digest via SipHash.

This is about twice as fast as SipHash, but the outputs differ.

The implementation uses custom AVX-2 vector classes with overloaded operators
(e.g. const V4x64U a = b + c) for type-safety and improved readability
vs. compiler intrinsics (e.g. const __m256i a = _mm256_add_epi64(b, c)).

## HighwayHash

We have devised a new way of mixing inputs with AVX-2 multiply and permute
instructions. The multiplications are 32x32 -> 64 bits and therefore infeasible
to reverse. Permuting equalizes the distribution of the resulting bytes.

The internal state occupies four 256-bit AVX-2 registers. Due to limitations of
the instruction set, the registers are partitioned into two 512-bit halves that
remain independent until the reduce phase. The algorithm outputs 64 bit digests
and can easily be extended to 128 or 256 bits.

In addition to high throughput, the algorithm is designed for low finalization
cost. This enables a 2-3x speedup versus SipTreeHash, especially for smaller
inputs.

For older CPUs, an SSE4.1 version is also provided.

## Results

Performance is measured as throughput for 1 KiB messages. The benchmark
measures the minimum elapsed time among many repetitions (thus ensuring
the inputs are cache-resident) but also updates an output variable to
ensure the compiler does not elide anything. The C++ implementations are
compiled with GCC 4.8.4 and run on a single core of a desktop Xeon E5-1650 v3
clocked at 3.5 GHz.

Variant | Throughput
--- | ---
SipHash | 2.2 GB/s
SipTreeHash | 5.1 GB/s
SSE41HighwayTreeHash | 6.5 GB/s
HighwayTreeHash | 12.3 GB/s

## Requirements

SipTreeHash and HighwayTreeHash require an AVX-2-capable CPU (e.g. Haswell).
SipHash has no particular CPU requirement.

## Build instructions

To build with Bazel (http://bazel.io/) : `bazel build :all -c opt --copt=-mavx2`
To build with Make : `make`

Note on project structure: the highwayhash/ subdirectory allows users to
include "highwayhash/sip_hash.h" rather than just "sip_hash.h". Keeping BUILD
in the project root directory shortens the Bazel build command line.
This requires "highwayhash/" prefixes in all Bazel and Makefile rules.
Adding "." to the include path enables highwayhash/ prefixes in our cc files.
