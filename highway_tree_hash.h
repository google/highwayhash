// J-lanes tree hash based upon multiplication and "zipper merges".
//
// Robust versus timing attacks because memory accesses are sequential
// and the algorithm is branch-free. Requires an AVX-2 capable CPU.
//
// "key" is a secret 256-bit key unknown to attackers.
// "bytes" is the data to hash (possibly unaligned).
// "size" is the number of bytes to hash; exactly that many bytes are read.
//
// Returns a 64-bit hash of the given data bytes.
